    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Kamkar, who had dropped out of high school at 16 and founded a software startup called Fonality at 17, says he just wanted to impress his techie friends, nothing more. Everything started around a week earlier, Kamkar tells me. At the time, MySpace gave users a lot of freedom to customize their profiles, allowing the use of HTML code, which resulted in colorful, and often painful to look at profiles Not everything on MySpace, however, was completely customizable. Users could only upload 12 photos, for example. Was there a way around that? Kamkar he started hacking around, trying to see if he could trick MySpace to do stuff the site wasn't supposed to let users do. He soon found a way and uploaded 13 photos.

        Users also had only a few choices when it came to the "relationship" field. There was a dropdown menu with standard options: married, single, in a relationship, and a few more. Kamkar, who at the time had a girlfriend, wanted to be able to select "in a hot relationship." With some more hacking, he did that too.
        
        "Once I was able to do that, I realized I was able to actually do anything on the page," he tells Motherboard, recalling that fateful night.</p>

      <h4><b>Samy kamkar</b></h4>
      <p> Samy Kamkar (born December 10, 1985)[1] is an American privacy and security researcher, computer hacker and entrepreneur. At the age of 16, he dropped out of high school.[2] One year later, he co-founded Fonality, a unified communications company based on open-source software, which raised over $46 million in private funding.[3] In 2005, he created and released the fastest spreading virus of all time,[4] the MySpace worm Samy, and was subsequently raided by the United States Secret Service under the Patriot Act.[5] He also created SkyJack, a custom drone which hacks into any nearby Parrot drones allowing them to be controlled by its operator [6] and created the Evercookie, which appeared in a top-secret NSA document[7] revealed by Edward Snowden and on the front page of The New York Times.[8] He has also worked with The Wall Street Journal, and discovered the illicit mobile phone tracking where the Apple iPhone, Google Android and Microsoft Windows Phone mobile devices transmit GPS and Wi-Fi information to their parent companies. His mobile research led to a series of class-action lawsuits against the companies and a privacy hearing on Capitol Hill.[9] Kamkar has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss' book Tools of Titans.</p>
